### Preface

Good day folks,

It has been a busy busy year that forced me to be apart from my blog.
But here we are again, jump from Linux to BSD.

### 1: A Well Oops

One day, I try to cheer my self up, by buying a second handed notebook.
After ten days, setting up W7, Proxmox, Void, Funtoo, and NixOS.
The notebook was ready to be use as my daily basis working station.
Well you know, I have to face a busy busy month ahead of me.
Before I sleep, I decide to install my last OS, the latest True OS,
and I accidentally wipe all partition in that notebook.
Oo wwhat a mess...?@#!!!

![linux: gparted][image-ss-void-gparted]{: .img-responsive }

After a while, I feel a warm bright light in my mind, and give me this idea: 
__This is it!! It is time to give BSD family a try.__
After find time, started at weekend, I try some distribution.

> Kill the boy, and let the man be born

#### One Week Journey

My personal historical journey

* The True OS server.
  The very moment that wipe all the notebook partition.

* The old True OS desktop.
  Realize It doesn't detect my display river and wireless card.
  I give up and search for something easier.

* GhostBSD with UFS, multiboot with W7 64bit.
  Trying to setup wireless dongle because my internal card is not supported.
  I also try many kind of desktop environment.

* Trident with ZFS, I choose to use all hard drive space.
  And realize this volume manager is something cool.
  I also experience Lumina.

* TrueOS again, TrueOS again with ZFS.
  Realize it comes with no destktop, I finally get into xorg,
  after succeed in detecting my i915 display driver.

* Finally settle with multiboot of W7, GhostBSD and some linux.
  What has been an accident, leverage my knowledge.
  A blessed in disguise.

> I found that installing and using GhostBSD is as easy as Ubuntu or Manjaro.

#### Why GhostBSD

> Multiboot mean a chance to learn other OS.

After testing TrueOS, Trident and GhostBSD,
I finally decide to choose GhostBSD.
Between these three, GhostBSD is the only distribution,
that allow me to install BSD as multiboot.
Multiboot mean a chance to learn other OS.
I do not want VM, I desire native.

#### Screenshot

My first impression of the logo is that it looks like __hello kitty__.

### 2: How I did the Multiboot

> Do not mix this freebsd extended partition with any linux partition.

For MBR situation, it takes:

* One Primary Partition for Windows.
  Or two if you have windows system restore.

* Free Space for GhostBSD.
  Or Primary Partition to be converted later.

* Free Space for Extended Partiions.
  This could be used as container for some linux,
  swap, data partition, or maybe windows data.

#### Partitions Arrangement

Consider this screenshot, so you can figure out what I'm talking about.

![ghostbsd: gpart show][image-ss-ghostbsd-gpart-show]{: .img-responsive }

Note that I took this picture after installing GhostBSD.

#### Burning The Live ISO

It is easier to use USB these day than burning into DVD.

![ghostbsd: dd if pv of][image-ss-dd-live-usb]{: .img-responsive }

Just be sure that you choose the right device.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo dd if=/media/Works/iso-distribution/GhostBSD18.12.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4096
{% endhighlight %}

Or even better using `pv`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ dd if=/media/Works/iso-distribution/GhostBSD18.12.iso | pv -s 2700M | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb
{% endhighlight %}

#### Windows

This should be installed first.
I only use W7. There are places that you can get the ISO for free.
And for serial number that legal, 
I use the serial from the back of my second handed notebook.

Since my second handed DVD is broken. I must use USB installer.
It turn out that `dd` doesn't work for this windows ISO.
But finally I can get it works by using `woeusb` (`winusb`).

I only use 80 GB of for this NTFS partition.

#### GhostBSD

While in GUI installation, Pick UFS Custom Partittioning.

* Create FreeBSD Extended: about 160 GB.

* Create inside it: root, home, swap.

Before installing GhostBSD, make sure that it has free space.
Do not create extended partition using Windows,
as it will give partition with `erb` type that won't match to use with UFS.
UFS need the partition type to be `freebsd`.

You can use `cfdisk` for any linux live to setup this partition.
but I rather use GhostBSD installer.
Or even better, UFS Custom Partitioning will do it for you.

FreeBSD booloader will detect W7. No need to worry.

#### Linux

I use Void, and it installed well.
The issue is GRUB won't detect FreeBSD. 
So we have to customize `40-grub-custom` manually.

{% highlight config %}
$ sudo cat /etc/grub.d/40_custom 
#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0

menuentry "GhostBSD" {
    insmod ufs2
    insmod bsd
    set root='hd0,msdos3'
    kfreebsd /boot/loader
}
{% endhighlight %}

Reboot... and Voila... it all works.

#### Other partition

I setup 60GB data partition dedicated to be shared between linux and BSD.

I also setup other linux as well, Funtoo, 
and one partition that likely change from time to time.

#### Partition Editor

FreeBSD came with no `gparted`. You can use `sade` instead.

### 3: Disk Management

Well, this is basically just my install log.

#### fstab

By the time I finished the fresh install,
the `fstab` looks like this:

{% highlight config %}
# Device    Mountpoint    FStype    Options  Dump Pass
/dev/label/rootfs0      /           ufs         rw,noatime  1  1
/dev/label/usrhome0     /usr/home   ufs         rw,noatime  1  1
/dev/label/swap0        none        swap        sw  0  0
procfs      /proc       procfs      rw          00
linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs   rw    00
tmpfs       /compat/linux/dev/shm   tmpfs       rw,mode=1777 0 0
{% endhighlight %}

#### Mount using CLI

There is a few differences mounting in FreeBSD.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo ntfs-3g /dev/ada0s2 /media/System
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo ext4fuse /dev/ada0s6 /media/Works/
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo mount_msdosfs /dev/da1s1 /media/Flash/
{% endhighlight %}

#### Mount using fstab

And as always, `fstab`.

{% highlight config %}
/dev/ada0s2     /media/System   ntfs   mountprog=/usr/local/bin/ntfs-3g,allow_other,late,rw          0       0
/dev/ada0s6     /media/Works    ext4   mountprog=/usr/local/bin/ext4fuse,allow_other,late,rw         0       0
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike linux, I should always use `sudo`, until I find a way.
