	There are so many things to say.
	I don't want to live in regrets.
	So I make this blog.

Hello, my name is Epsi. I'm an open source enthusiast.
I have made a ready to use, Jekyll site customization.

{% include page/social-accounts.html %}

Although I like command line, I'm not a hacker.
You won't find any illegal activities in this site.

This is my temporary about page. 
I haven't got time to decorate it yet.
I'm still busy of something else.
For a while, this page contain site setup.

	It's not that I need to share.
	I just want to back it up to cloud.

If you need, there is a guidance on how to setup Jekyll Blog.

	Installing Jekyll is something cool.
	Having an example of working site is something else.

	I know nothing. Nothing at all.
